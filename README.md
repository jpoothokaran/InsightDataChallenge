Hello Insight Team,

Thanks for taking the time to check out my solution

The only file that needs to be run is donation-analytics.py file in the src folder
The file imports the following packages: numpy and time

I am new to working with github and online submissions and so my submission may be missing some pieces
-I don't know how to include the dependencies on the python packages (time and numpy) that I'll need in a git repo
-I'm not sure if my input files will be read correctly using run.sh (I did call them './input/filename' in the .py file)
-I didn't get a chance to test my output file, althgouth I did follow the formatting required for the output textfile

Thanks for the chance to participate in the challenge. It was interesting and I learned a few things
