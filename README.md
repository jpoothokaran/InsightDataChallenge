Hello Insight Team,

Thanks for taking the time to check out my solution

The only file that needs to be run is donation-analytics.py file in the src folder
The file imports the following packages: numpy and time

I am new to working with github and online submissions - I didn't get a chance to test if my output file is one that you'll be able to work with, althgouth I did follow the formatting required for the output textfile
